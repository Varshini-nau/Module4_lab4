        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In converting my resume to HTML, I made several structural choices to ensure the content was clearly organized and easy to read. Here are the key decisions and reasons behind them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> I chose Arial for its readability and professional look. It's a clean, sans-serif font that works well for both headings and body text.</li>
            <li><strong>Sizes of Headings and Main Text:</strong> The main text is set to 1rem for readability, with headings incrementally larger to create a clear hierarchy. H1 is 2em, H2 is 1.5em, and H3 is 1.2em.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> I used a blue (#0056b3) for headings to create a professional and calming appearance. The background is a light gray (#f4f4f9) to reduce eye strain.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin and Padding Choices:</strong> The body has no margin or padding to utilize the full viewport space. Sections and headers have margins to create space between content, and padding within sections enhances readability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
        <p>I corrected any misuse of HTML tags. For example, I ensured that the highest-level headings used <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags and structured subheadings with <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tags appropriately.</p>
